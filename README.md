# @enveloppe/debug

This project is a simple debug/testing utility for the Enveloppe project.

It will send dummy generated markdown file to a configured GitHub repository, seeing if the GitHub works properly outside of Obsidian.

## Installation

```bash
bun i
```

To initialize environment variables, run:

```bash
bun run init
```

## Usage

```bash
bun run
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.39. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
